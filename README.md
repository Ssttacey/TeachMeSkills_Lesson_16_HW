Homework for the sixteenth lesson

We created a class to describe the client.
The client class contains fields to describe the client (registration date, name, age).
The customer class contains a collection field with orders for this customer.
The order class must contain fields to describe the order (price, description and name).
We have created several clients, for each client several orders. Orders are placed in the order collection field.
We created a collection of type Mar and filled it with pairs “client passport number” -> “client class object”. The passport number is stored in constants in the interface.
A program can display on the screen using a loop:
- all key-value pairs, using Map.Entry<K, V> entry : map.entrySet()
- all key-value pairs, using an iterator
- all keys using map.keySet()
- all values ​​using map.values()
